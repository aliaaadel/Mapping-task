the approach for solving this task is to segment each row of map and creat an array of image 3x1 grid .then detect each shape in the image .
the grid .py is to creat the grid and enter the coordinate for the shape and draw the corresponding shape on the grid .
the mapping task2021.py is for segmentation of the grid .
